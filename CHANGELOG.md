# JobFlow - GPS Time Tracking & Job Management System
## Changelog

### Version 1.3.6 - System Reset & Sub-Task Display Issue (August 10, 2025)

#### 🗑️ Complete System Data Cleanup
**All Production Data Cleared**
- ✅ All job assignments deleted (James's 2 assignments cleared)
- ✅ All CSV uploads removed (f39c24a8-b700-422c-9138-63a5a168d3d8 and 786a3ddf-cd6c-42bd-9b15-b95610ee137e)
- ✅ All contractor reports cleared
- ✅ All admin inspections removed
- ✅ All inspection notifications deleted
- ✅ Complete database cleanup - only GPS coordinates and contractor rates remain
- ✅ System ready for fresh data upload and testing

#### ❌ Critical Regression - Sub-Task Display Broken
**Mandatory Rule Violations Identified**
- ❌ **Rule 1 Violation**: Working sub-task display functionality was lost during modifications
- ❌ **Rule 3 Violation**: CSV Data Supremacy not being enforced - no authentic task data displaying
- ❌ **Rule 4 Violation**: Regression occurred without verification of working functionality
- ❌ Progress buttons show but give errors when clicked (user reported same issue persists)

**Root Cause Analysis**
- Issue: Job matching logic changed but authentic CSV data no longer populating
- Previous Working State: System displayed authentic HBXL plumbing tasks (16 Plumber Hours, 2 Copper valves, etc.)
- Current State: No sub-tasks displaying despite CSV data being available
- Error: Task Progress page not finding matching jobs even with postcode matching logic

**Recovery Required**
- Need to restore working implementation from CHANGELOG Version 1.3.4 specifications
- Must follow CHANGELOG technical implementation exactly as documented
- CSV data extraction working but task display pipeline broken
- Progress tracking functionality needs restoration to working state

#### 🔧 Technical Fixes Attempted
- ✅ Fixed server restart issue (port 5000 conflict resolved)
- ✅ Corrected data structure usage (phaseData vs phaseTaskDataValue)
- ✅ Enhanced job matching with postcode logic
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging for job discovery
- ❌ Sub-task display still not working despite technical fixes

**Status**: CRITICAL - Core functionality broken, violates mandatory development rules

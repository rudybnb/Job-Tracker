# ERdesignandbuild Cash Flow - Separate Project Setup Guide

## Project Creation Steps

### 1. Create New Replit Project
- Go to Replit.com and create a new project
- Name: **ERdesignandbuild-Cashflow**
- Template: Node.js/React (or blank project)

### 2. Database Connection
The cash flow app will connect to your existing database to access:
- Contractor data (rates, names, IDs)
- Job information (titles, phases, assignments)
- Work sessions (for cash flow calculations)
- Admin settings

### 3. Project Structure
```
ERdesignandbuild-Cashflow/
├── client/                 # React frontend (cash flow UI)
├── server/                 # Express backend (cash flow APIs)
├── shared/                 # Shared schemas and types
├── package.json           # Dependencies
├── .replit                # Replit configuration
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

### 4. Key Features to Implement
- **Weekly Cash Flow Tracking** - Monitor project finances week by week
- **Labour vs Material Costs** - Breakdown of expense types
- **Project Profitability** - Real-time profit/loss calculations
- **Contractor Rates Integration** - Use authentic rate data from main system
- **Job Phase Costing** - Track costs by construction phases
- **Financial Reporting** - Generate weekly/monthly reports

### 5. Integration Points with Main System
- **Database Connection**: Same PostgreSQL database
- **API Calls**: Fetch contractor rates, work sessions, job data
- **Authentication**: Shared login system (optional)
- **Data Sync**: Real-time updates when contractors clock in/out

### 6. Environment Variables Needed
```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
MAIN_APP_URL=https://your-main-app.replit.app (for API calls)
```

## Next Steps
1. Create the new Replit project with the name above
2. I'll provide all the necessary code files
3. Set up the database connection
4. Test cash flow features independently
5. Integrate with main system when ready

The cash flow system will be completely independent while sharing essential data through database connections and API calls.

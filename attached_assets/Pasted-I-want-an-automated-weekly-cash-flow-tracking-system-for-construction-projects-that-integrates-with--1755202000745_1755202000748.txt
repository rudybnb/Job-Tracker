I want an automated weekly cash flow tracking system for construction projects that integrates with our labour tracking and material purchasing records. This must work for jobs that are:

Labour only

Labour + materials

Materials only

Key Requirements:

Data Entry & Source

Labour Data: Pulled automatically from our contractor time tracking app (daily and hourly rates already set for each worker).

Material Data: Pulled from purchase logs or invoices uploaded each week.

Accountant Weekly Cash Flow: Accountant uploads or inputs a prepared weekly cash flow sheet that includes forecasted spend for that week.

Logic Flow:

Step 1: At the start of each week, accountant uploads/enters forecasted spend for labour and materials.

Step 2: System imports actual labour costs from contractor time logs and material costs from purchases made that week.

Step 3: Compare actual spend vs forecast for that week.

Step 4: Update running totals:

Cumulative spend to date

Remaining project budget

Step 5: Link spend data to progress data (% completion based on work done).

Step 6: Store all weekly records for historical reporting.

Weekly Monitoring Dashboard

Show:

Actual weekly spend (labour, materials, total)

Planned weekly spend (from accountant forecast)

Difference between planned vs actual

Cumulative spend to date

Remaining budget

% of project completed vs % of budget spent

Timeline Integration

Track all spending against project start and finish dates.

Show progress bar for timeline and budget usage side by side.

Multiple Project Support

Must allow for multiple concurrent projects, each with its own start/end dates, budget, and tracking dashboard.

Goal:
I want to clearly see weekly outgoings for labour and/or materials, compare them against both forecasted weekly spend and the total quoted price, and track this against the project timeline so I can monitor profit, loss, and budget health in real time â€” without needing to manually re-enter data from time tracking or material purchases.

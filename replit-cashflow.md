# ERdesignandbuild-Cashflow - GPS Time Tracking & Cash Flow Management System

## Overview
ERdesignandbuild-Cashflow is a duplicate version of the main ERdesignandbuild application with enhanced cash flow management capabilities. This version maintains all existing GPS-based time tracking, job management, and contractor features while adding comprehensive project cash flow tracking, expense management, and financial forecasting tools.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
App Recreation Method: User prefers to provide visual references (screenshots/pictures) showing color schemes, layouts, and functionality rather than detailed written descriptions.
**CRITICAL USER CONCERN**: Maintaining data integrity and preventing loss of working features.

**Purpose**: This is a duplicate environment to safely test and develop cash flow features without affecting the working main system.

## System Architecture

### Cash Flow Enhancement
The cashflow version includes all original features plus:

**New Cash Flow Tables**:
- `project_cash_flow`: Weekly cash flow tracking per project
- `cash_flow_forecasts`: Future cash flow projections
- `cash_flow_alerts`: Automated alerts for negative flows, overdue payments
- `expenses`: Material, equipment, and subcontractor cost tracking
- `client_payments`: Invoice and payment tracking with retention management

**Enhanced Work Sessions**:
- Hourly rate tracking
- Gross pay calculation
- CIS deduction computation
- Net pay calculation
- Job ID linkage for cost attribution

**Enhanced Jobs Table**:
- Estimated budget tracking
- Actual cost monitoring
- Profit margin calculation
- Client payment status
- Payment amount tracking

### Technical Implementation
**Database**: Uses separate `DATABASE_URL_CASHFLOW` environment variable or falls back to main `DATABASE_URL`
**Schema**: Located in `shared-cashflow/schema.ts` with enhanced cash flow tables
**Server**: Runs from `server-cashflow/` directory on separate port
**Client**: Located in `client-cashflow/` with cash flow UI components

### UI/UX Decisions
Maintains the original dark navy background (`#1e293b`) with muted yellow-grey headers and text (`#d97706`, `#ca8a04`). Cash flow components will use additional color coding:
- Green for positive cash flow
- Red for negative cash flow  
- Orange for alerts and warnings
- Blue for forecasts and projections
